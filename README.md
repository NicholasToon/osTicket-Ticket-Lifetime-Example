<h3> This is the stage when a new ticket is created. There are a couple of ways to submit a ticketâ€”either by filling out a form, like the one shown here, or by sending an email to a designated ticketing address. To ensure that your issue is resolved (provided you find yourself submitting a ticket), you will want to enter your contact information, describe the topic/issue, and provide all the necessary details about the problem. </h3>
